# Sitecore-MVC-Editor
Adds wrappers for Sitecore MVC placeholders and renderings in Experience Editor.

This code has been tested on Sitecore 8.1 Update 1, but should work for any version 8 of Sitecore. In addition to the code here, you'll need to include the following Sitecore DLLs from your installation (not included here due to licensing):
     Sitecore.Kernel.dll
     Sitecore.Mvc.dll 
     Sitecore.Mvc.ExperienceEditor.dll
